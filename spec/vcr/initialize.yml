        till I was 18 a promptly moved to Dallas to begin school and just \"get out\"
        of Fort Worth. Began coding developing websites for my group of online friends
        with simple HTML and it gradually grew a little more complicated. I put coding
        on the back burner for years only picking it back up when I was bored, but
        loved it more and more each time I did it. I recently had an opportunity to
        pursue education and decided against the traditional CS degree and decided
        really get hands on experience with Bloc.","photo_file_name":"Screen_Shot_2016-05-25_at_1.27.08_PM.png","photo_content_type":"image/png","photo_file_size":2093854,"photo_updated_at":"2016-05-25T18:27:33.862Z","send_new_message_emails":true,"referred_by_id":null,"slug":"jonathan-gonzales","os":"OS
